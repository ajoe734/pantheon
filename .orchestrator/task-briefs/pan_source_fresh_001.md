# Task Brief: PAN-SOURCE-FRESH-001

Generated in the worker workspace because the supervisor root did not have a task brief file.

## Task
- Title: Formalize guarded source refresh and Agora freshness
- Status: review
- Owner: Codex
- Reviewer: Codex2
- Next: Codex2 independently re-reviewed 7e159061f and found both findings from d2633fae0 resolved. Reviewer evidence is ready for the governed approve transition back to Codex for finalization, latest-dev integration, PR, checks, merge, and hosted-proof handoff.

## Coordination Root
- Auto workers inherit `PANTHEON_STATUS_ROOT`, `PANTHEON_COMMAND_ROOT`, and `PANTHEON_COMMAND_RUNTIME_SHA` from the supervisor.
- Run `$PANTHEON_COMMAND_ROOT/scripts/ai-status.sh` for governed status changes; git, tests, and product edits continue in this task worktree while canonical status, activity, archive and lock writes are routed to the validated central root.
