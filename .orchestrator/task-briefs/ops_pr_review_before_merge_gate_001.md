# Task Brief: OPS-PR-REVIEW-BEFORE-MERGE-GATE-001

Generated in the worker workspace because the supervisor root did not have a task brief file.

## Task
- Title: Gate task auto-merge on exact independent review when required
- Status: in_progress
- Owner: Codex
- Reviewer: Codex2
- Next: Owner closeout found PR #4218 behind current dev and the governed review_approved records unbound because runtime 1434effdc88fb79abd0125351a5206af8fe4a7c7 predates review_binding. Refresh the same task branch to authoritative dev, rerun the focused matrix, and return the new exact head to Codex2; owner and reviewer remain unchanged.

## Summary
讓需要獨立審查的任務在 reviewer 核准且 head 未變前不得 auto-merge；保留明確允許 merge 後審查的既有路徑。

## Coordination Root
- Auto workers inherit `PANTHEON_STATUS_ROOT`, `PANTHEON_COMMAND_ROOT`, and `PANTHEON_COMMAND_RUNTIME_SHA` from the supervisor.
- Run `$PANTHEON_COMMAND_ROOT/scripts/ai-status.sh` for governed status changes; git, tests, and product edits continue in this task worktree while canonical status, activity, archive and lock writes are routed to the validated central root.
