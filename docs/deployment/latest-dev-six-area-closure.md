PR6093 = BFF-CLOSURE-REGRESSION-20261002 (`b6599f9fd`), PR6094 = DIRECT-BFF-OWNERSHIP-001 (`88ce3faff`),
both merged. DIRECT-RAY-BASELINE-001 was NOT DELIVERED (see `docs/operations/research-framework-disposition.md`);
RLlib/Ray stays as on `dev`.

## Integrated source checks (merged origin/dev, no hidden skips)

- BFF architecture / migration / journal / owner-readback set (12 files under `services/control-plane/bff/tests`):
  234 passed, 1 failed. The one failure, `test_journal_runtime_contract.py::test_factory_unavailable_owner_returns_503_without_replacement`
  (`NameError: resolve_with_stand_ins`, missing import at line 391), reproduces identically on an `origin/dev` export
  and is owned by BFF-COMPOSE-FAIL-CLOSED-20261006; it is not fixed or masked here.
- FE (`front-ai-trading-system` @ `5ff40dd23`, `bun install --frozen-lockfile`): `tsc -p tsconfig.app.json --noEmit` exit 0;
  `npm test` 32 tests, 32 pass, 0 fail, 0 skipped; `vite build` exit 0; `bff:scan:ci` exit 0.

## Not yet proven

The live twelve-loop isolated gate (acceptance 2/3) is run by Human/Ops outside the worker sandbox; its run report
and SHA256 are recorded under `docs/deployment/evidence/L12-SOURCE-CLOSURE-20261002/` once provided.
