## §15 CORS — Lovable Preview and Published Origins

### Gap

The BFF CORS allowlist had two deficiencies that caused browser `CORS` failures for
Lovable-hosted frontend deployments:

1. **Missing execute-plans project origin.** The Lovable project that hosts the
   `execute-plans` frontend has UUID `140c41d5-9cd8-4d6b-ba02-66d5941d0dbe`. Its
   published preview URL `https://140c41d5-9cd8-4d6b-ba02-66d5941d0dbe.lovableproject.com`
   was absent from `_DEFAULT_LOVABLE_CORS_ORIGINS` and from the `docker-compose.yml`
   default. This caused CORS rejections from the Lovable in-IDE preview pane.

2. **Dynamic preview URL format not handled.** Lovable per-commit preview URLs follow
   the format `https://id-preview-<commit_hash>--<project_uuid>.lovable.app`. The commit
   hash changes with every deployment, so exact-match allowlists cannot enumerate them.
   The previous list had the static entry
   `https://id-preview--b75d3452-...lovable.app` (no commit hash), which does not match
   any real Lovable-generated URL. Observed live preview URL:
   `https://id-preview-a7067bd5--140c41d5-9cd8-4d6b-ba02-66d5941d0dbe.lovable.app`.

### Fix

**File: `services/control-plane/bff/main.py`**

- Added `https://140c41d5-9cd8-4d6b-ba02-66d5941d0dbe.lovableproject.com` to
  `_DEFAULT_LOVABLE_CORS_ORIGINS` (and `_DEV_LOVABLE_CORS_ORIGINS` so it is filtered
  out in production strict mode).

- Added `_LOVABLE_PREVIEW_UUIDS`, `_LOVABLE_PREVIEW_ORIGIN_REGEX`, and
  `_LOVABLE_PREVIEW_ORIGIN_PATTERN` constants covering both known project UUIDs
  (`b75d3452-f667-4cf4-893a-1061de45b347` and `140c41d5-9cd8-4d6b-ba02-66d5941d0dbe`).

- Updated `_build_bff_app()` to pass `allow_origin_regex` to `CORSMiddleware` when
  not in production strict mode. This enables the FastAPI/Starlette middleware to accept
  `id-preview-<commit>--<uuid>.lovable.app` origins without enumerating every commit.

- Updated `_cors_origin_allowed()` to check the regex pattern in addition to the exact
  match list (non-strict mode only).

**File: `docker-compose.yml`**

- Added `https://140c41d5-9cd8-4d6b-ba02-66d5941d0dbe.lovableproject.com` to the
  `PANTHEON_BFF_CORS_ORIGINS` default value.

### Production Strict Mode Boundary

- The regex is suppressed (`allow_origin_regex` is not set) when `_is_production_strict_mode()`
  is `True` (i.e., `PANTHEON_BFF_AUTH_MODE=strict` + `PANTHEON_ENV` or
  `PANTHEON_DEPLOYMENT_STAGE` in `{canary, live, prod, production, staging-live}`).
- `https://140c41d5-9cd8-4d6b-ba02-66d5941d0dbe.lovableproject.com` is in
  `_DEV_LOVABLE_CORS_ORIGINS` and is therefore filtered from the allowlist in
  production strict mode, matching the existing policy for dev-tier origins.

### Acceptance Criteria

| # | Criterion | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `_cors_origins_from_env()` in dev mode includes `140c41d5...lovableproject.com` | ✅ test added |
| 2 | `_cors_origins_from_env()` in production strict mode excludes the above origin | ✅ test added |
| 3 | CORS preflight for `id-preview-<commit>--140c41d5-...lovable.app` returns 200 in non-strict | ✅ test added |
| 4 | CORS preflight for `id-preview-<commit>--b75d3452-...lovable.app` returns 200 in non-strict | ✅ test added |
| 5 | CORS preflight for an unknown UUID preview URL is rejected | ✅ test added |
| 6 | CORS preflight for known-UUID preview URL is rejected in production strict mode | ✅ test added |
| 7 | `_cors_origin_allowed()` returns `True` for known-UUID preview URL in non-strict | ✅ test added |
| 8 | `_cors_origin_allowed()` returns `False` for unknown-UUID preview URL | ✅ test added |
| 9 | `pytest services/control-plane/bff/tests/test_auth_jwks_strict.py` passes 15 tests | ✅ verified |
